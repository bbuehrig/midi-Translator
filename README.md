# midi-Translator
This is an Arduino based project for communication manipulation for MIDI messages. The idea was born as a simple translator for MIDI messages sent by a simple MIDI foot-controller to a MIDI device like an FX-processor. I need it for translating ProgramChange messages to ControlChange messages sent by a Boss FC50 MIDI foot-controller. The ControlChange messages were sent towards an Fractal Audio Axe-FX II for controlling the scene switching.

Fell free to improve and adapt it for your own MIDI helper!
